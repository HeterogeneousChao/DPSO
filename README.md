# Alg_CombPSO

Alg_CombPSO focusses on covering array generation with particle swarm optimization(PSO). It is a Visual Studio project.

Alg_CombPSO has implemented two differnet approaches based on differnet representations of particle's velocity, including:

* Convenrional PSO

* Discrete PSO

Four PSO variants (both convenrional and discrete versions) are also implemeted:

* Time-Varying Acceleration Coefficients (TVAC)

* Comprehensive Learning PSO (CLPSO)

* Multi-Swarm PSO (DMS-PSO)
 
* Adaptive PSO (APSO)
